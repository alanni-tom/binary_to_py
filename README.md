------

This is a script that converts Python compiled binary files into the Python source code you want. I used:

1.  [pyinstxtractor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor/master/pyinstxtractor.py)
2.  `uncompyle6`

In other words, it is an integrated script file, and you can make secondary modifications based on it.

```python
python main.py -f <binary_file> -o <output_resource_dir>
```
